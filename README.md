# Usage

You can set a hotkey or use a File Action to extract `.cab` files in place. Note that the original `.cab` file won't be removed. Personally, I prefer to use ⌃-⌘-⇧-E.

1. Select one or more `.cab` files in Finder.
2. Press your hotkey combo.
3. The `.cab` asset catalog(s) will be extracted into folders using the corresponding filenames.
